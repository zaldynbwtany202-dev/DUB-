"""Dub the Phantom Thread clip, one subtitle cue at a time.

Two problems with the earlier pass drove this rewrite.

**Drift.** Speaker turns were recorded as a single continuous take and dropped
at the turn's start time. Every line after the first then landed wherever the
narration happened to reach — measured drift ran to 1.9 s by the end of a long
turn. Now each cue is anchored to its own timestamp, so an error in one line
cannot propagate into the next.

**Quality.** Pitch/formant conversion measurably degraded the recordings
(harmonics-to-noise ratio dropped by up to 1.4 dB) and tempo compression made
them sound hurried. Casting is still decided by the actor's measured pitch, but
the audio itself is left alone unless a line genuinely overruns its slot.

Timing and script both come from the burned-in subtitles.
