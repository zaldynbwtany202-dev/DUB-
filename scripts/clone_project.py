Run where HuggingFace is reachable (GitHub Actions, or any normal machine):

For each speaker the cleanest stretch of that actor's separated voice is used as
the cloning reference, and every one of their lines is then generated in that
voice. Existing takes are backed up rather than overwritten, so a failed or
disappointing clone can be rolled back.

Nothing here is destructive if the weights are missing: the script says so and
exits, leaving the project exactly as it was.
